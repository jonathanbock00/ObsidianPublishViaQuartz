![[Pasted image 20240925173650.png|400]]

Often times I do not want to cook, but still eat a healthy and delicious meals. Since I have to eat, I try to follow the [[Automate or eliminate]] concept.

Automation is achieved by using the [[Instant pot]] as main cooking device. Cooking automation allows me to choose. Sometimes I want to to cook manually for fun and other times I only need a [[No effort meal]] quickly.

The other way to get a healthy and nearly [[No effort meal]] is to eat a raw dish. The nature of a raw dish is that there is no cooking involved. The actual cooking part usually takes most of the time.
