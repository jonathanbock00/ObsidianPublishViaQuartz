# Why Am I Doing This?
It is quite easy to overlook how much progress I have made.
Makes progress visible.
Gives an opportunity to be grateful.
Gives an opportunity to celebrate reached goals and milestones.
Every so often it is important to take a moment and ask "Am I still going towards my goals? Do I need to change course?"
Some tasks do not need attention every single day. It is more efficient to collect these mini task over a week or a month and then batch process them.
# What is Stopping Me from Doing This?
Having messy and bloated review templates. Only include absolute necessities. Not more.
Doing a review also means you need to look at things how they are right now. This can be emotionally challenging. It is easier you just not look.
# How Can I Overcome This?
Use [[Theta programming]] to allow yourself to look at the things how they are.
# What Goals Guarantee Success over Time?
Limit weekly and monthly review task amount to maximum of 10.
# What Tasks / Habits Guarantee Success?
Have a reclaim habit that auto schedules at every sunday for weeklies and first week of the month for last month for the monthly. On sunday's I have the most time usually.
Write a [[Weekly review template]].
Write a [[Monthly review template]].
Maybe extend later to yearly and quarterly reviews. For not just weekly and monthly.
Write a [[Quarterly review template]].
Write a [[Yearly review template]].
