# Note
- Avoid cooking soaked or unsoaked red or yellow lentils on their own in the Instant Pot, as they’ll get mushy after only a few minutes. They can be cooked 1 minute or up to 30 minutes on HIGH if cooked with other ingredients that require a longer cooking time.
- Don’t cook red lentils on their own, they are always part of a recipe with more ingredients.
- Soaked lentils are easier to digest.
- Many legumes, like dried raw beans, are typically soaked for several hours, even overnight, to **neutralise lectins**. However, lentils are low enough in PHA that they don’t require soaking.
- For this Instant Pot Lentils recipe, **both soaked and unsoaked lentils will work.** You’ll just need to adjust the cooking times. Personally, **I always soak my lentils**. I’ve found they’re much **easier to digest** this way. Plus, lentils soak quickly compared to most other legumes, only requiring **2-4 hours of soak time**. If you’re pressed for time, then you can **quick soak your lentils with some boiling water** for 20 minutes or so before rinsing and cooking.
