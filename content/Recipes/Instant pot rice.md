# Note
- Max. 5 cups raw of rice can be cooked in an [[Instant pot]].
- Rinsing the rice before cooking is not necessary.
- Cooking time stays the same no matter how many cups of rice are cooked at once.
- If keeping warm, leave the lid closed after the pressure release to retain steam and prevent the rice from drying out and sticking to the bottom.
