# How I think about cooking

![[Pasted image 20240925173650.png|400]]
Often times I do not want to cook, but still eat a healthy and delicious meals. Since I have to eat, I try to follow the [[Automate or eliminate]] concept.

Automation is achieved by using the [[Instant pot]] as main cooking device. Cooking automation allows me to choose. Sometimes I want to to cook manually for fun and other times I only need a no effort meal quickly.

In addition I only cook recipes that tick the following checkboxes.

- [ ] max. 15 min prep time
- [ ] simple and common ingredients
- [ ] maximum 10 ingredients per dish
