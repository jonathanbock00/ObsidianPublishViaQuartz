![[Pasted image 20240927114924.png|500]]

A digital garden is a personal knowledge base that's organised like a garden. Just as a real garden is a place where you cultivate plants, a digital garden is a place where you cultivate your knowledge.

# Here's how it works
- You plant ideas: You create notes or articles on topics that interest you. These are like the seeds you plant in your garden.
- You let them grow: Over time, you add to and refine these notes, just like tending to your plants.
- You connect them: You link related notes together to create a network of interconnected ideas, similar to how plants grow and connect in a garden.

# Why use a digital garden?
- Organize your thoughts: It helps you organize your ideas and knowledge in a structured way.
- Discover connections: You can discover unexpected connections between different topics.
- Enhance learning: It's a great way to deepen your understanding of complex subjects.
- Share your knowledge: You can share your digital garden with others to spread your ideas.
