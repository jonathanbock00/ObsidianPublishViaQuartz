# Why Am I Doing This?
Whenever I eat unhealthy and highly processed foods, I get super tired, which makes me lazy and stay on the couch all day. This prevents me from creating the life I want. I need food that helps me to life how I want to life.

On the other hand eating whole foods, in addition with raw food, keeps my energy up all day long and I do not have to rest to digest. My sleep quality is better and eating healthy also elongates my life span and I would like to get at least 100 years old.

Cooking can be extremely time consuming especially if you want to eat fresh healthy food. Investing a lot of time on a basic task like making food means, I cannot easily tackle other tasks that move my life vision forward.
# What is Stopping Me from Doing This?
- Having a simple recipe collection with proven go-to [[No effort meal]]s
- I don't go grocery hopping on regular basis.
- I do not use a shopping list, which leads to me just buy random foods.
- Sometimes I go grocery shopping while hungry, which leads to buying too fatty, salty, simple carbohydrate foods.
- I don't like cleaning the kitchen or cleaning kitchen appliances at all.
- If I spent the day at someone else's place it is very tempting to order fast food or eat what they eat.
